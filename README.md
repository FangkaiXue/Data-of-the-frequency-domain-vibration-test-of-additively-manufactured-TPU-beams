# Data-of-the-frequency-domain-vibration-test-of-additively-manufactured-TPU-beams
Additive manufacturing can fabricate strctures with unprecedent geometry complexity and multiple materials, which makes it a ideal method for the manufacturing of damping structures. To facilitate further applications of additive manufactuting in vibration damping structures, we characterize and optimize the vibration damping properties of thermoplastic polyurethane structures manufactured by fused filament fabrication. This work is supported by the laborotory of ERPI and LEM3 of the University of Lorraine.

The raw data of the frequency-domain vibration test of the printed TPU beams is collected in this repository. The first dataset contains the data of the taguchi test of TPU specimens. The second dataset contains the data of the optimized TPU specimens. Each text file contains the vibration displacement of TPU specimens versus the frequenyc of excitation from the electrodynamic shaker.

The diffusion and reutilization of this dataset is welcomed with a clear citation of the author and the establishment:
